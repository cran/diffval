Description: Find, visualize and explore patterns of differential taxa in
    vegetation data (namely in a phytosociological table), using the
    Differential Value (DiffVal). Patterns are searched through
    mathematical optimization algorithms. Ultimately, Total Differential
    Value (TDV) optimization aims at obtaining classifications of
    vegetation data based on differential taxa, as in the traditional
    geobotanical approach (Monteiro-Henriques 2025,
    <doi:10.3897/VCS.140466>). The Gurobi optimizer, as well
    as the R package 'gurobi', can be installed from
    <https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/>.  The useful
    vignette Gurobi Installation Guide, from package 'prioritizr', can be
    found here:
