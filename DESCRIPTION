Description: Find, visualize and explore patterns of differential taxa
    in vegetation data (namely in a phytosociological table), using the
    Differential Value (DiffVal). Patterns are searched through
    mathematical optimization algorithms. Ultimately, Total Differential Value
    (TDV) optimization aims at obtaining classifications of vegetation data
    based on differential taxa, as in the traditional geobotanical approach.
    The Gurobi optimizer, as well as the R package 'gurobi', can be
    installed from <https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/>.
    The useful vignette Gurobi Installation Guide, from package
    'prioritizr', can be found here:
